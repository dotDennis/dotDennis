### Hello, Folks! <img src="icons/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Dennis LÃ¸vold and I'm a Front-End Developer from Norway. Currently I'm working on taking a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering, with the goal to become a Full-Stack Developer. I'll be attempting to post frequent updates, so that you can tag along my 'stack' journey.
